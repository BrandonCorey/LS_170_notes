# Application Layer #
The topmost layer with protocols that provide communication services to applications
- These are the protocols that the application most directly interacts with (HTTP, SMTP, FP etc...)
- The application can also interact with transfer layer protocols (e.g opening a TCP socket), but almost never with any lower layers
- Application protocols are more concerned with the syntax and structure of a message, whereas the lower layers focus on delivering that message
- The primary protocol for communication on the web is HTTP

### Web vs Internet ###
Internet - A global network of networks that serves as the infrastructure to enable inter-network communication between devices
Web - A layer on top of the internet comprising of web pages, web servers, and web clients (browsers) that communicate using the HTTP protocol
